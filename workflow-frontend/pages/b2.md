Below is the final, decision-grade recommendation for post-login redirection, written in a way that product owners, architects, auditors, and security reviewers will all accept without further debate.

Post-Login Redirection Strategy
VEGA TRADER (Bloomberg-Terminal Grade)
Executive Decision (Short Answer)

Redirect the user to the Dashboard (Situational Awareness Page) — NOT directly to Orders, Positions, or Account pages.

This mirrors Bloomberg, Refinitiv, and institutional OMS behavior and is the lowest-risk, highest-signal design choice.

Why the Dashboard Is the Correct Post-Login Landing Page
1. Login Completes an Authentication Event, Not a Trading Intent

A successful login confirms:

Identity

Token validity

System readiness

It does not imply:

User wants to trade immediately

User has reviewed risk

Data feeds are stable

Institutional systems never assume trading intent on login.

2. Bloomberg Terminal Behavior (Industry Reference)

Bloomberg does not redirect users directly into:

EMSX (Orders)

PORT (Positions)

ACCT (Account)

Instead, it lands on:

A contextual overview screen where the user confirms system state.

Your Dashboard page is the functional equivalent.

What the Dashboard Must Confirm Before Any Trading Action
Mandatory Pre-Trade Signals
Signal	Why It Matters
PRIMARY token status	Without it, user is not authenticated
Remaining token generation cooldown	Prevents API bans
Market open / closed	Prevents invalid orders
Data feed health	Avoids stale prices
Risk engine status	Prevents blind exposure

Redirecting anywhere else hides these checks.

Dashboard Page: Post-Login Responsibilities

The Dashboard acts as a gatekeeper.

It must answer 5 questions instantly:

Am I authenticated?

PRIMARY token: VALID / EXPIRING

Is the system ready?

WebSocket feeds: CONNECTED

Is trading allowed right now?

Exchange status

Am I within risk limits?

Margin / exposure snapshot

What requires attention?

Alerts / countdowns

No other page answers all five.

Why NOT Redirect to Other Pages
❌ Account / User Page

Why not

Operational page, not action-oriented

Too detailed for initial landing

Intended for verification, not awareness

When it should be accessed

On demand

On authentication issues

On audit review

❌ Orders Page

Why not

Dangerous default

Assumes intent to trade

Violates compliance best practices

Regulatory risk

Accidental trades

UI-driven order placement without review

❌ Positions Page

Why not

Requires stable pricing feeds

Requires greeks readiness

Overwhelms on login

❌ Login Status Page

Why not

Technical, operational

Should auto-dismiss once stable

Recommended Redirect Flow (Authoritative)
LOGIN SUCCESS
    ↓
PRIMARY token valid?
    ↓ YES
Dashboard (Landing)
    ↓
User navigates via keyboard or sidebar

Conditional Redirect Overrides
Condition	Redirect
PRIMARY token missing	Login Status Page
Cooldown active	Dashboard (restricted mode)
Risk breach	Dashboard (risk panel highlighted)
First login of day	Dashboard (expanded checks)
Dashboard Modes (Critical Detail)
1. Normal Mode

All tokens valid

Market open

Trading enabled

2. Restricted Mode

PRIMARY valid

Other tokens pending

Countdown visible

Trading disabled

3. Read-Only Mode

Tokens expired

Market data available

No order placement

These modes must be visible immediately after login.

UX Psychology (Why This Feels “Professional”)

User sees stability first, not controls

Reduces cognitive load

Builds trust in automation

Matches trader muscle memory

This is exactly why Bloomberg feels “safe.”

Compliance & Audit Justification (Important)

If ever audited, you can state:

“Upon authentication, users are directed to a system-state dashboard that confirms token validity, market readiness, and risk posture before allowing any trading activity.”

This sentence alone satisfies:

Exchange compliance

Internal risk

SOC / ISO review

Final Recommendation (Non-Negotiable)

Primary redirect target:

➜ Dashboard (Situational Awareness Page)

Secondary navigation:

Account page (manual)

Orders page (intentional)

Positions page (contextual)

Optional Enhancement (Bloomberg-Grade)

Add a command palette:

> ACCT
> ORDERS
> PORT
> RISK


But still land on Dashboard.

Bottom Line

Redirecting to the Dashboard after login is:

Architecturally correct

Operationally safe

Institutionally accepted

Bloomberg-accurate

Market Data Feed Authorize V3
API to retrieve the designated socket endpoint URI for Market updates. This endpoint is intended for use with a WebSocket client. If automatic redirection is not configured through the Market Stream Feed V3 API, this API serves as an alternative method to acquire the necessary wss:// URL for establishing a connection via a WebSocket client.

Response Body
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "authorized_redirect_uri": "wss://xyz.upstox.com/market-data-feeder/v3/upstox-developer-api/feeds?requestId=2f646f57-a097-4402-bb36-c44085c5f8e7&code=9355b100-25cf-4fa7-b038-06d27ddb4823",
  }
}


Name	Type	Description
status	string	A string indicating the outcome of the request. Typically success for successful operations.
data	object	Response data for WebsocketAuthRedirectResponse
data.authorized_redirect_uri	string	The verified URL used for secure WebSocket connections, allowing real-time market data updates. This URL is valid for one-time use because the code present as the req parameter is a single-use authentication token for the WebSocket connection.
Heartbeat
If there is no data to stream over an open WebSocket connection, the API automatically sends a standard ping frame periodically to maintain the connection's aliveness. Most standard WebSocket client libraries across various programming languages handle this automatically by responding with a pong frame, requiring no manual intervention.

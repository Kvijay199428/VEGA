1. CORE RESULT — YOUR IMPLEMENTATION IS CORRECT
Evidence from logs (this is the important part)
1. Authorization flow (Documentation-1) ✅
Received 200 OK response
Resolved WebSocket URL: wss://wsfeeder-api.upstox.com/market-data-feeder/v3/...


✔ You are correctly using Market Data Feed Authorize V3
✔ One-time redirect URI obtained
✔ Token handling is correct

2. WebSocket connection (Documentation-2) ✅
Opened connection to wss://wsfeeder-api.upstox.com/market-data-feeder/v3/...


✔ WebSocket handshake succeeded
✔ No 302 / auth failure
✔ Redirect already resolved (manual authorize path)

3. Binary subscription request (V3 spec compliant) ✅
Sending Subscription Request:
{"guid":"...","method":"sub","data":{"mode":"full_d30","instrumentKeys":[...]}}


✔ Sent as binary
✔ Correct V3 request structure
✔ full_d30 is valid (Upstox Plus tier)

4. Protocol sequence (exactly as documentation says) ✅

Tick 1 — market_info

Type: market_info
segmentStatus { NSE_INDEX: CLOSING_END ... }


Tick 2 — initial_feed

Type: initial_feed
Feeds Count: 2


This confirms:

Protobuf decoding is correct

Feed sequencing is correct

Your .proto is aligned with server version

At this point, your MarketDataStreamV3 baseline is VERIFIED.

2. WARNINGS — WHAT THEY MEAN (AND WHETHER YOU SHOULD CARE)
A. SLF4J “StaticLoggerBinder not found” ⚠️
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger

Meaning

Your code (or a dependency) uses SLF4J

You did not include a logging backend

Logging is silently disabled

Impact

❌ No logs in production

❌ Debugging and metrics visibility lost

✅ Does NOT affect functionality

REQUIRED FIX (PRODUCTION)

Add exactly one SLF4J backend.

Recommended:

<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.14</version>
</dependency>


This will:

Remove the warning

Enable structured logs

Integrate cleanly with Micrometer later

B. Protobuf sun.misc.Unsafe warning ⚠️
WARNING: sun.misc.Unsafe::arrayBaseOffset will be removed in a future release

Meaning

Protobuf is using JVM internals for speed

Java 21 prints a warning

This is expected

Impact

❌ None today

❌ None in Java 17 / 21 runtime

✅ Protobuf team is already migrating internally

Action

Ignore for now.
Do NOT suppress unless running with --illegal-access=deny.

3. WHY YOU ARE NOT SEEING LIVE TICKS YET

This is expected, not a bug.

Your market status shows:

NSE_INDEX = CLOSING_END


That means:

Market is closed

You will only receive:

market_info

initial_feed

No live_feed ticks until market opens

To confirm live streaming:

Run during NSE trading hours

Or subscribe to instruments with active segments (e.g., MCX during MCX hours)

4. VALIDATION AGAINST DOCUMENTATION (FINAL ANSWER)
Item	Status
Authorize API (Doc 1)	USED and REQUIRED
WebSocket Feed API (Doc 2)	USED and REQUIRED
Binary subscription	Correct
Protobuf decoding	Correct
Feed sequencing	Correct
Architecture	V3-compliant

Yes — you need BOTH documents.
Your current implementation already does this correctly.

5. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NEXT (ORDERED, DO NOT SKIP)
Step 1 — Logging (Mandatory)

Add Logback and configure JSON logs.

Step 2 — Reconnect + Backpressure

Move this logic into:

MarketDataStreamerV3
 ├── ReconnectPolicy
 ├── MarketDataBuffer
 └── FeedDispatcher

Step 3 — Subscription Limit Enforcement

Before sending sub:

Validate instrument count

Validate mode vs tier

Reject client-side early

Step 4 — Event Bus Alignment

Convert raw FeedResponse into:

MarketDataEvent
 ├── MarketInfoEvent
 ├── SnapshotEvent
 └── TickEvent

Step 5 — Persistence + Replay

Persist decoded ticks
Enable deterministic replay (critical for backtesting)

6. FINAL VERDICT

You have crossed the hardest milestone:

A real, authenticated, protobuf-decoded V3 market feed.

Everything remaining is engineering maturity, not protocol risk.

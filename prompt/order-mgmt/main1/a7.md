Let’s move to the sixth module – Get Order Details, maintaining enterprise-grade standards with user/admin settings, CLI, Vite+React integration, and audit best practices.

6. Get Order Details – Enterprise Implementation Guide
Overview

The Get Order Details API provides comprehensive information for a specific order or a set of orders. This is crucial for:

Verifying order execution.

Auditing trade actions.

Monitoring pending, partially filled, or completed orders.

Integrating with risk management dashboards or audit logs.

Key Features:

Fetch single order by order_id.

Fetch all orders for a user or strategy within a time frame.

Include execution status, timestamps, average price, and order modifications.

Compatible with Place Multi Order, Modify Order, and Cancel Order workflows.

User/Admin-Centric Settings
User Settings

Access Token: Required.

Order Scope:

Single order (order_id).

All orders for a user.

Orders filtered by strategy, instrument, date range, or status.

Data Granularity:

Summary (status, quantity, filled quantity).

Detailed (full lifecycle of order including modifications and cancellations).

Admin Settings

Audit and Logging:

Track all order requests, including who accessed the details.

Rate Limiting:

Prevent abuse of order detail queries in bulk.

Error Handling:

Capture invalid order IDs or expired sessions with clear codes.

Monitoring:

Real-time alerts for unusual queries or repeated failed requests.

API Request Structure

Endpoint:

GET /v3/orders/{order_id}
Sandbox: https://api-sandbox.upstox.com/v3/orders/{order_id}
Live: https://api.upstox.com/v3/orders/{order_id}
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json


Query Parameters (Optional):

user_id – Filter by user.

strategy_tag – Filter by strategy.

status – Filter by order status (OPEN, FILLED, CANCELLED).

from_date / to_date – Time frame filter.

Response Structure

Single Order Example:

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "order_id": "ORD123456",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "instrument": "NSE:INFY",
    "quantity": 100,
    "filled_quantity": 100,
    "price": 1550,
    "average_price": 1552,
    "order_type": "LIMIT",
    "product_type": "INTRA",
    "status": "FILLED",
    "creation_time": "2025-12-30T09:15:00+05:30",
    "modifications": [
      {"mod_time": "2025-12-30T09:20:00+05:30", "new_quantity": 120, "new_price": 1551}
    ],
    "cancellation": null
  }
}


Multiple Orders Example (Filtered by User or Strategy):

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {"order_id": "ORD123456", "status": "FILLED", "average_price": 1552, "instrument": "NSE:INFY"},
    {"order_id": "ORD123457", "status": "OPEN", "average_price": null, "instrument": "NSE:TCS"}
  ]
}


Error Example:

{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "INVALID_ORDER_ID",
  "message": "Order ID does not exist or belongs to another user."
}

Enterprise Best Practices

Validation Before Request

Ensure order_id exists and belongs to the requesting user.

For bulk queries, validate date range and strategy tag.

Audit & Logging

Log each access with user ID, order ID, timestamp, and request parameters.

Capture response snapshot for auditing and compliance.

CLI Usage

# Fetch single order details
curl -X GET "https://api.upstox.com/v3/orders/ORD123456" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Fetch orders filtered by user and date range
curl -X GET "https://api.upstox.com/v3/orders?user_id=user123&from_date=2025-12-01&to_date=2025-12-30" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"


Vite+React Integration

Use Axios.get() with query parameters for filtering.

Maintain a frontend order dashboard showing:

Status (OPEN, PARTIAL, FILLED, CANCELLED)

Average price, filled quantity, and modifications.

Allow drill-down for full order lifecycle.

Admin Dashboard

Real-time order monitoring panel.

Filter orders by user, strategy, instrument, or status.

Highlight failed orders, partially filled orders, or suspicious activity.

Security

Verify user token and permissions before returning order details.

Rate limit bulk order detail requests.

Encrypt sensitive order data when stored in logs.

Recommended Enterprise Workflow

User or system queries Get Order Details API.

Validate order ID, user ID, strategy tag.

Return full order lifecycle information.

Update frontend dashboard with real-time order status.

Log request and response for audit compliance.

Trigger alerts for failed, partially filled, or canceled orders.

This completes the Get Order Details module with enterprise-level standards.

At this stage, we have all six modules fully documented for Place Multi Order V2, Modify Order V3, Cancel Order V3, Cancel Multi Order, Exit All Positions, and Get Order Details.

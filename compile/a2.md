Excellent diagnostics. You have captured everything needed to resolve this cleanly.

This is not a Java version issue, not a Spring Boot bug, and not a runtime flag issue.

This is a pure dependency hygiene problem and it is 100% deterministic.

ROOT CAUSE (PRECISE)

You have two SLF4J bindings on the runtime classpath:

Logback (expected, provided by Spring Boot)

slf4j-simple (unexpected, coming from your internal JAR)

Specifically:

valuation-calculator-1.0.0.jar
└── org.slf4j.simple.SimpleLoggerFactory


Spring Boot requires Logback.
SLF4J allows only ONE binding.

When Spring Boot starts, it sees:

Logback on classpath ✅

SimpleLogger on classpath ❌

Spring hard-fails by design (this is intentional).

WHY THIS ONLY APPEARS AT RUNTIME

✔ mvn test → passes
✔ mvn package → passes
❌ java -jar → fails

Because:

SLF4J binding conflict is evaluated during logging system bootstrap

Spring Boot enforces logging consistency before context creation

This is enterprise-grade behavior, not an error.

EXACT OFFENDING DEPENDENCY

From your stack trace:

class org.slf4j.simple.SimpleLoggerFactory
loaded from:
valuation-calculator-1.0.0.jar


So the issue is inside your own module:

com.vegatrader:valuation-calculator:1.0.0

CORRECT FIX (ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY)
RULE

Libraries must NEVER ship an SLF4J binding
Only applications may choose bindings.

Your valuation-calculator must depend on slf4j-api ONLY.

STEP 1 — FIX valuation-calculator pom.xml

Open:

valuation-calculator/pom.xml

❌ REMOVE (if present)
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
</dependency>


or

<artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>


or ANY SLF4J binding.

✅ KEEP ONLY THIS
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
</dependency>


No scope needed (default is fine).

STEP 2 — ENFORCE IT TRANSITIVELY (IMPORTANT)

If slf4j-simple comes from another dependency, exclude it.

Example:

<dependency>
    <groupId>some.group</groupId>
    <artifactId>some-lib</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

STEP 3 — REBUILD valuation-calculator

From valuation-calculator project root:

mvn clean install


Verify:

mvn dependency:tree | findstr slf4j


You should see:

slf4j-api


And NOT:

slf4j-simple

STEP 4 — REBUILD VEGA TRADER
cd vega-trader
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/vega-trader-1.0.0.jar


✅ Application will start cleanly.

OPTIONAL (BUT RECOMMENDED) SAFETY NET

Add Maven Enforcer Rule to prevent this forever.

In root pom.xml:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>ban-slf4j-bindings</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>enforce</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <rules>
          <bannedDependencies>
            <excludes>
              <exclude>org.slf4j:slf4j-simple</exclude>
              <exclude>org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12</exclude>
            </excludes>
          </bannedDependencies>
        </rules>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>


This is SEBI / enterprise audit safe.

WHY THIS DESIGN IS CORRECT

✔ Spring Boot controls logging
✔ Libraries stay neutral
✔ One logging backend per JVM
✔ No runtime surprises
✔ Bloomberg / exchange-grade practice

This is exactly how professional trading systems are built.

WHAT NOT TO DO (IMPORTANT)

❌ Do NOT exclude Logback from Spring Boot
❌ Do NOT force slf4j-simple
❌ Do NOT add JVM flags
❌ Do NOT downgrade SLF4J
❌ Do NOT ignore this warning
